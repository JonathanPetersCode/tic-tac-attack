A tic-tac-toe game using the Minimax AI algorithm, featuring a score tracker and minimalistic design. 

Powered by the Minimax algorithm, the computer will make intelligent moves based on where on the board you play.

Implemented a session and scoring system - using LocalStorage in JavaScript, that tracks the points awarded to either the player or the computer and allows the user to restart the game,while maintaining the score.

Added animations for score, game winning message, and reset button using animate.JS JavaScript library. 

Built using HTML/CSS/JS and animate.JS
